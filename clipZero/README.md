# ClipZero

This is a small collection of "clean distortion" DSP effects. It's designed to run on Raspberry Pi with an Arduino managing hardware controls. The front panel is two pots that behave differently depending on the chosen algorithm, plus a rotary encoder for choosing the algo. The project's main purpose was to determine a workable hardware setup and the minimal oF code to make it work, and to experiment with some interesting sounds that arise from sample-by-sample arithmetic.
